If Licensor breaches its primary obligations with simple negligence, then its liability shall be limited to the amount which was foreseeable for Licensor at the time when the respective duty was performed. Any further liability of Licensor shall be excluded on the merits.

11.3 The right to set off a claim shall be limited to such claims that are uncontested or have been finally established with legal effect.

13.4 Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of Licensor.
